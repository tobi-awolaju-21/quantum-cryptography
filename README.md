# quantum-cryptography
This repo contains QC projects for cryptography, including BB84 protocol and more. Each project has its own directory, code, and docs to showcase my skills and provide a reference for others. Projects were developed using Qiskit &amp; other quantum computing frameworks, and can be used as a starting point for researchers &amp; developers interested in QC.
